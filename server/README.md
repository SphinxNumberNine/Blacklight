To test server locally:

- make sure `server` folder is updated with master copy
- run `npm install` from within the server folder to ensure dependencies are updated
- run `npm run dev` from within the server folder
  - this runs the server in development mode using the `nodemon` package, allowing for the server to be auto-restarted whenever a change is made
- press `ctrl + c` to exit the server if required
